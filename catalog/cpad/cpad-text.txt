Acknowledgement of Indigenous and Native Lands
The GIS data in CPAD and CCED are based on land ownership or legal easements that restrict how lands
can be used. The ownership focus of the databases is intended to assist in the planning, management,
and long-term care of lands owned by government agencies and nonprofits for open space purposes.
The lands represented here are the traditional unceded territory of more than 100 nations. To learn
more about a particular territory please visit the California Native Heritage Commission’s Digital Atlas.
We recognize that the Western perspective of land ownership is limited and does not reflect an
important range of cultural views, especially of many Indigenous peoples. Furthermore, land ownership
as a structure has been used to promote empire and colonization.
These data represent only one lens of how to view California’s landscape. CPAD and CCED are not
intended to represent, replace, or negate different cultural views of lands such as spiritual ownership,
stewardship, or caretaking.
As we seek to respect the many diverse Indigenous people connected to this land from time
immemorial, we welcome feedback on how to improve and address non-Western perspectives and how
to respectfully represent them. Email us at cpad@calands.org.

Summary

The California Protected Areas Database contains data about lands that are owned outright (“in fee”)
and protected for open space purposes by over 1,200 public agencies or non-profit organizations. CPAD
lands range from the smallest urban pocket parks all the way to the largest wilderness areas – all told,
CPAD inventories over 50 million acres in 16,000 “parks” (known in CPAD as Super Units). CPAD is
published by GreenInfo Network (www.greeninfo.org), a nonprofit technology support organization
founded in 1996.
Access to CPAD GIS data is through the California Natural Resources Agency’s open data portal – see
www.CALands.org for more information. CPAD is available in Esri shapefile format and consists of three
related data sets – HOLDINGS (parcel-level components of parks and preserves), UNITS (commonly
named holdings sharing the same access level within counties) and SUPER UNITS (units that are
dissolved on the land manager and extend across counties – these are mostly for recreation-focused
applications).
Any depiction of CPAD data to illustrate public access must NOT include closed lands and must note lands
coded as “restricted” as requiring permits or having limited operating times.
This is the second release of CPAD in 2025, and includes the following improvements:

Current CPAD Release Improvements (v. 2025b)
The 2025b release of CPAD includes the following updates:
●​ An increase of 20,000 acres to CPAD holdings from 2025a from various data submissions
submitted between June to December 2025.
●​ Parcelization across the board of large lands, resulting in more accurate and detailed
parcel-aligned holdings.

Introduction

The California Protected Areas Database (CPAD) inventories open space lands that have been protected
for open space uses through fee ownerships. A separate database – the California Conservation
Easement Database (CCED)* – tracks lands protected through conservation easements (more below).
CPAD is not a database of all public lands – for example, it does not include public buildings, water treatment
sites, or other non-open space public land.
CPAD is suitable for a wide range of planning, assessment, analysis, and display purposes. CPAD should
not be used as the basis for official regulatory, legal, or other such governmental actions without more
detailed review of current official land records in the area of focus.
The lands in CPAD are defined by their owning and managing agencies at the Holdings and Units levels. At the
Super Units level (a version of the release meant primarily for recreation applications, and for general
cartography), CPAD lands are defined simply by name, managing agency, and public access.
Access to CPAD GIS data is through the California Natural Resources Agency’s open data portal – a download
link and more information about CPAD is at www.CALands.org. CPAD is released in shapefile format. The state
site also hosts map services with CPAD data displayed by Access Type, Agency Classification, and Agency
Level. This is a great resource for web developers interested in displaying CPAD data already classified and
designed by GreenInfo’s team of cartographers.

CPAD has been developed by GreenInfo Network (www.greeninfo.org), a non-profit technology support
organization. Financial support for CPAD varies over time, most recently coming mainly from the
California Natural Resources Agency. Many other agencies, foundations and nonprofits have supported
CPAD in the past (See Acknowledgments for a listing).

*NOTE ABOUT EASEMENTS: For conservation easement holdings, GreenInfo Network developed a second
database called the California Conservation Easement Database (CCED). CCED feeds into a national inventory
of easement holdings (the National Conservation Easement Database, or NCED). This national dataset is
available at www.conservationeasement.us. CCED is available, with documentation, from www.CALands.org.

Data Definitions

CPAD Geography
CPAD covers the entire area of California. In most counties, CPAD boundaries are aligned to digital
assessor parcel boundaries (see “Known Issues in CPAD” below for exceptions). These boundaries are
used to create three levels of CPAD geography: HOLDINGS, UNITS, and SUPER UNITS. See the Database
Structure section for more information.
The following are key elements in the CPAD data definitions:
“Protected” Status
Lands in CPAD must be protected for open space purposes through fee title ownership (easements are in
a separate database). The purpose for the fee title ownership must be primarily for the continuation of
open space values. CPAD “protected” status does not mean a specific level of conservation for
biodiversity values (e.g., a USGS GAP rank). Instead, “protection” refers to a general commitment to
maintain the property for any of a wide range of open space uses, listed below.
Several caveats about land ownership and CPAD:
●​ Leases, contracts, term easements and regulatory controls adopted through land use planning
processes are not considered “protected lands” in CPAD, as they are not fee ownerships (even
though they may provide important protection to open space lands)
●​ Lands owned by public agencies that may have some open space values but that are not
explicitly owned or held to protect those values are not included in CPAD. (Examples: a utility
easement, unless it is also used or planned to be used as a non-motorized trail corridor intended
for public use; a school with no joint use agreement for use of its play areas; a wastewater
treatment plant; military installations).
●​ U.S. Bureau of Land Management lands are all included in CPAD, even though significant areas of
these lands may be sold or traded over time to better configure and conserve public land
resources. Similarly, U.S. Forest Service ownerships are included even though actively harvested
(a legitimate resource-based open space use) and occasionally traded.
●​ Particularly for federal lands, only ownerships are included in CPAD – lands only in proclamation
or planning boundaries are not part of CPAD (these are only areas of possible future jurisdiction
or management, and often encompass private lands).

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

Open Space Uses
The lands in CPAD typically serve one or more of the following open space purposes:
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

Habitat Conservation – Wildlife or plant reserve protected specifically for habitat
Recreation – Active recreation (city parks, parks with developed areas, hiking, etc.)
General Open Space – Open land serving a broad range of purposes
Historical/Cultural – Historic sites, museums with large open areas
Forestry – Active forest harvesting, tree growth for forestry
Agriculture – Crop lands including developed pastures
Ranching – Grazing lands - dry and grazing pasture
Water Supply – Watersheds, waterways
Scenic Area – Usually part of other uses, however, sometimes called out
Flood Control – Flood plains, natural flood control channels (but generally not concrete or other
impervious structures unless incidental to the overall holding)

Open Space vs. Hardscape
Open space holdings in CPAD may include buildings or other hardscape areas, provided the hardscape is
subordinate or ancillary to the dominant open space purposes of the holding. As a general rule, the
holding is not considered open space if structures or other hardscape constitutes a large portion of the
total acreage (roughly more than half, based on visual inspection).
●​ Parking lots used principally for qualifying public recreational purposes are considered part of
the protected open space holding. In smaller urban parks, parking lots may not be included due
to difficulties in determining their relationship to park holdings and resource limitations for
fact-checking.
●​ Recreation facilities that are primarily buildings (e.g. indoor ball courts, swim centers, stadiums
without significant open space areas around them) are not included in CPAD.
●​ City parks in CPAD sometimes exclude major building areas from remaining open space, due to
lack of consistent and detailed information on which buildings are parts of parks. In general,
parks with more than half their area in building structures are not included in CPAD.
●​ Parklets are not included in CPAD, because they are usually entirely hardscape, extremely small,
and temporary in nature.
●​ Parks on building rooftops, while often open to public use, are not included in CPAD.

Additional Open Space Criteria
●​ Schools. Park-like areas that are parts of public schools are not included in CPAD unless there is
a known, defined agreement to allow those for public use (often called “joint use agreements”).
You can identify these schools by searching the Special Use field for “School JUA.” Only school

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

fields and other open spaces are included in CPAD. CPAD may include some school park sites
without such agreements – if you find these errors, please contact us at: cpad@calands.org
●​ Cemeteries. Privately-owned cemeteries are not considered protected open space, but
cemeteries owned by the public are considered open space – and are given a special use flag of
“cemetery” in the database attribute table.
●​ College Campuses. We only include off-campus open spaces such as University of California
Nature Reserves. All other campus areas (sports fields, green space, etc) are not included. For
GIS data of schools, including college campuses, see GreenInfo Network’s other data product,
the California School Campus Database (www.californiaschoolcampusdatabase.org).
●​ Golf courses. Privately-owned golf courses are not included in CPAD, but golf courses owned by
the public are and are given a special “golf course” flag in the database attribute table. Golf
courses owned by homeowners associations are considered privately owned and are not
included in CPAD.
●​ RV camping/parks. Publicly owned RV parks and similar highly-developed camping or lodging
facilities are not generally included in CPAD; however, if they are a subordinate part of a larger
protected open space area and are themselves protected through fee ownership, they may
qualify (e.g., if a state park has camping areas for RVs, those areas are included).
●​ Fairgrounds. Fairgrounds are not included in CPAD.
●​ BLM offshore islands that make up the California Coastal National Monument are included in
CPAD and marked as “offshore islands” in the Special Use field (they can be removed by query).
●​ Open land holdings of transportation agencies (highway medians, construction staging areas,
etc.) are generally not included in CPAD. (Note: such open space could be considered protected if
significant enough in size and permanently protected in such use through joint-agency
agreements or easements).
●​ "Remnant" parcels of open land whose location or configuration significantly impair any broader
open space purpose (e.g., highway or roadway shoulders or medians) are generally not included
in CPAD.
●​ If a non-open space use occupies a portion of a larger open space area, and it is a separate
parcel and functions separately from the larger open space area, then it is usually excluded from
CPAD. However, if it is not a separate parcel, and/or it is difficult to separate from the larger
open space area, then the entire area is included in CPAD.
●​ Holdings of water/flood control agencies that do not serve open space purposes are not
generally included – for example, concrete flood channels and developed access ways along such
channels or other open lands that only support the use of constructed facilities, unless those
facilities are a small portion of an overall open space holding owned by such an agency (e.g.,
dams that are part of recreation areas). However, trail corridors along such channels and water
detention basins are often included.
Ownership

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

11

CPAD includes protected areas owned by public agencies and nonprofits. Private owners are not
currently included, except for parkland owned by some homeowner associations and some conservation
mitigation sites.
●​ Military Lands. CPAD does not include Defense Department lands (DOD), except for a few public
recreation facilities (e.g. golf courses) which are coded as “federal” level.
●​ Tribal Lands. Tribal lands are sovereign lands and are not included in CPAD unless subject to
enforceable conservation restrictions.
●​ Homeowner Associations. CPAD includes some private park holdings owned by homeowner
associations (HOAs), particularly in Southern California, where they are most prevalent. These
lands are coded as Restricted Access because they are typically open only to the residents of the
association. Only a fraction of California’s HOA parks are currently captured in CPAD. These parks
are included since they provide important recreational opportunities even if restricted in use –
without including them, any estimates of urban park needs could be misleading. Expansion of
the CPAD inventory to cover more HOAs is under consideration. You can find all HOA parks in
CPAD by filtering the Special Use flag “HOA.”
●​ Private Owners. In many areas of California, open space is maintained by private owners
(usually LLCs or other corporate entities, but sometimes individuals), when it is required to be
dedicated as a condition of development. This category of land is not currently in CPAD but is
under consideration as there are some protected areas in this category.
Ownership vs. Management
CPAD tracks lands according to the agency that owns the title to the property. If another agency manages
the site, both agencies are noted: the owning agency is listed under ‘Owning Agency’ and the managing
agency is listed under ‘Managing Agency.’ CPAD listings by agency may therefore differ from similar
listings by an individual agency, where that agency is showing both owned and managed sites.
Public Access
CPAD lands are defined as Open Access, Restricted Access, or No Public Access. Restricted areas require
permits or have irregular hours. No Public Access areas are not open to the public. Any CPAD-based map
or web application of recreational opportunities must not include No Access areas and should indicate
that any Restricted lands require a permit or a check-in before visiting (some restricted lands also have
highly variable seasons or hours). Open Access means open to the public for agency-designated use,
and does not suggest what activities can or cannot occur on the land.
The best source of information for specifics about how to access individual parks is the managing
agencies themselves. Two agencies have particularly nuanced access:
●​ Many California Department of Fish and Wildlife lands are identified as Open Access, but all
visitors should refer to CDFW’s website for more information before planning a visit.
●​ Lands owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power are predominantly available to
the public for day use. Although the lands are open to the public, there are restrictions such as
no campfires or camping. The public should be advised that some lands are open for hunting and
must respect all signage for areas that may be closed (power facilities, restoration, exclusive use
areas, etc.). Any questions about access can be addressed to the LA DWP office via their Support
page.

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

Land and Water
Water areas of protected fee land holdings (tidal areas, coastal areas, lakes/reservoirs) are included for
most of the state and identified with a “water” code. Water boundaries are taken from a variety of
sources including 100K DLG and the National Hydrology Dataset (NHD), and in some cases manually
drawing the water boundary using aerial imagery. Some revisions have been made for Bay Area tidal
zones. CPAD does not show creeks, streams, or very small water bodies (i.e., small lakes, ponds under 10
acres). The water/land attribute is only in the HOLDINGS feature class.
Water area definition is important for counties with large areas of tidelands (primarily in the San
Francisco Bay Area) where such acreage counts can create a misleading picture of publicly-available
lands. ​
Parcel Boundaries
In general, CPAD is intended to be aligned to assessor parcel boundaries. However, in some rural areas of
the state there is differing opinion on the spatial accuracy of these lines, and federal agencies often
define their boundaries with the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), which may differ from assessor lines.
This issue is still being addressed in CPAD, as there is no one “correct” system for rural area boundaries –
sometimes parcel lines are accurate, sometimes PLSS, and sometimes neither. In metropolitan or other
developed areas, parcels are almost always of good accuracy and are consistently used in CPAD (though
not every CPAD holding is yet aligned to parcels). In areas where parcel boundaries appear out of date or
incorrect, aerial imagery is used as a supplement for alignment.
Agencies and organizations with highly detailed surveyor data can request CPAD use those results for
alignment. If requested, and when possible, the CPAD database aligns to the survey boundary. It should
be noted that this can cause conflicts with immediately adjacent properties. If authoritative boundaries
are needed, the relevant agencies should be contacted for official data.
It should also be noted that county assessors regularly update both the ownership and alignment of
parcels. This can occasionally cause shifts in the parcel boundary as compared to aerial imagery or a park
boundary. As a result some parks may appear to have a slightly shifted location. We aim to avoid
frequent updates that do not improve a park location and typically do not realign a park unless the new
location appears to be more accurate.

Database Structure​
​

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

​
The key framework of the database is the division of open space lands into the following feature classes,
illustrated for this CPAD unit. CPAD is provided in ESRI shapefile format, with separate shapefiles for
HOLDINGS, UNITS and SUPER UNITS.

HOLDINGS are the individual parcels of protected
lands.
HOLDINGS level information is the most detailed
and should be used for any analysis.

UNITS are aggregations of HOLDINGS based on a
common site name within each county.
Note:
●​ UNITS aggregated HOLDINGS by the
following key fields: Park Name, Access,
Managing Agency, Owning Agency, and
County
●​ Some UNITS may be comprised of a single
HOLDING, while others aggregate a large
number of HOLDINGS
●​ UNITS may include multiple HOLDINGS that
are not contiguous
●​ UNITS have fewer attributes and are
primarily used for sub-county analysis or for
cartographic purposes

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

14

SUPER UNITS are aggregations of UNITS to create
use-focused polygons for each park name.
SUPER UNITS are useful for recreation applications
and for cartographic representation.
Note:
●​ SUPER UNITS aggregate units based on the

Park Name, Access, and Managing Agency
●​ SUPER UNITS maintain distinct units for
different types of public access
●​ SUPER UNITS cross county boundaries
●​ SUPER UNITS are the most generalized
representation of CPAD, and are primarily
used for cartographic purposes, or to
support recreational access application

CPAD Data Procedures

CPAD makes use of a wide range of data sources, including source agency databases, parcel data from
counties, and other research. In general, the following approach has been taken:
1.​ Agency source data: Source agency GIS data is secured for agencies where it is available. With
more than 1,500 agencies and organizations having holdings in CPAD, contact with each of these
is not possible. However, the top 50 agencies/organizations own over 98 percent of the acreage
in CPAD and most have available source GIS data. In some cases, non-GIS source data may be
acquired and used for digitizing. Not all agencies with lands in CPAD have completely accurate
records, so additional research is sometimes required, and many smaller agencies do not have
available or easily available source GIS data for their holdings.
2.​ Parcels as geometry base: CPAD uses assessor parcels as its base geometry in almost all of
California (in the southern deserts, most BLM lands which are mainly based on the Public Land
Survey System (PLSS) are currently left in that system due to resource limits and issues with
some parcel data there – however near urbanized areas, BLM lands may be aligned to parcels).
Assessor parcels are not always completely accurate, particularly in undeveloped rural areas, and
some adjustments may be done in collaboration with source agency data (notes are provided in
CPAD about alignment methods used). Parcel data is also used to identify holdings not available
in agency source data or that are unclear from that data.
3.​ Cross-check with other data: Other existing protected lands information is then correlated with
the parcel data – this includes prior data sets, along with GIS data sets for other related agencies
or planning projects. For city, county and special district parks, checks of agency web sites are
used as well (however, many cities do not have clearly-defined park maps available).
4.​ Resolving conflicts: Agency source data is generally considered to be authoritative. However, in
case of data conflicts between agencies or with assessor boundaries, the following guidelines are
used: in urban areas, assessor parcels are given precedence regarding geometry; in rural areas,
if the owning agency explains that its data is gathered by survey or analysis of coordinate
geometry and that it is confident of its boundaries, that geometry can supersede the assessor
parcels (particularly with BLM or USFS holdings). Where agencies differ about their holdings,
efforts are made to review these issues with the agencies (often the issue is that one agency
owns a site while the other operates it) and reach a resolution. When that is not possible, best
judgment is used by GreenInfo Network staff and the reason for a decision is noted in the data
record.
5.​ Aerial image checks: 1-meter or better aerial photography is used to check boundaries – where
there are assessor parcel conflicts with aerial imagery, operator judgment is used to decide
which has precedence, but in general the rule of thumb is that parcel data will be more reliable
in urban settings, and agency data will be more reliable in rural settings.

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

22

6.​ Water: Where a holding extends over significant water bodies or tidal zones, the shape is
divided into sections coded as land or water, with the USGS National Hydrography Dataset being
used to define water areas. Coastal shorelines are defined using a modified, more accurate
version of the official California county data file – these boundaries are matched visually through
high resolution aerial photography to coastal features and do not represent scientific judgments
about high water marks (Note: future releases will use the State’s new coastline data set).
Smaller water bodies (i.e., under 10 acres) are generally not coded as water at all.
7.​ County divisions: Where a park or other property spans a county boundary, it is separated into
separate UNIT records for each county (e.g., a National Forest holding that extends across two or
more counties), and then merged into a single SUPER UNIT. Because CPAD’s foundational
geometry is based on county assessor’s parcels, county boundaries are largely defined by those
parcels, and may sometimes differ with official county boundaries from Cal Fire.
8.​ Scale of use: In general, CPAD is accurate to at least 1:24,000 scale, but parcels and some
agency datasets have improved this to 1:5-10,000 or better in many parts of the state.

GAP Codes

Starting with the 2021a release, we have included additional details about the GAP status of easements.
GAP codes are a USGS-defined metric that reflects management intent (USGS 2020, Prior-McGee 1998).
GAP codes are categorized on a scale from 1 to 4 where GAP 1 and 2 are areas primarily managed with
the intent to protect biodiversity, GAP 3 are areas managed for multiple uses including conservation,
recreation, and extraction and GAP 4 has no known mandate for biodiversity protection. Data for GAP
codes in CPAD is sourced from PADUS, CDPR and Local Agencies/Organizations
Details about the geoprocessing are available through calands.org.1 It is important to understand that
the acreages reported are estimates and for that reason have been rounded using the following
methods:
Any property less than 1 acre rounds the GAP acreage to two decimal places. Properties that are 1 acre
or larger have their GAP acreage rounded down to the nearest whole numbers. This rounding helps
reduce the reporting of slivers and helps reduce the perception of higher accuracy beyond what is
significant.
We estimate the error introduced as a result of this rounding, is less than 2% of the total CCED acres.
PADUS

Additional information on geoprocessing steps can be found at:
https://www.calands.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Method-for-Including-Gap-Codes-in-CPAD-and-CCED.pdf
CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

23

With a geo-spatial intersection of CPAD and PADUS we assume an easement can contain acreage under
multiple GAP codes. The results of this process ultimately assign GAP codes to approximately 91% of the
acres inventoried in CPAD.
California State Parks
The inclusion of GAP codes from California State Parks cover land owned and/or managed by CDPR, this
accounts for roughly 5% of GAP codes being reported.
Local Agency/Organization
As of the 2024a release, the remaining 4% of GAP codes reported in CPAD have been sourced from the
group that owns and/or manages the land.
Completing the GAP Inventory
CPAD lands are predominately assigned GAP codes from PADUS, as many of the fee lands in California
are managed by federal or state agencies - both of which are well inventoried via PADUS. When
available, we defer to the GAP code provided by the most local agency/organization. California’s 30x30
effort has, and will continue to, offer opportunities to work with groups to define accurate GAP codes to
lands they own and/or manage.

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

Known Data Issues in CPAD

CPAD has become increasingly complete over the past years and is now estimated to include over 99% of
the protected lands in California, but some issues do remain. The main issues in CPAD are coverage and
alignment:
1) Overlaps occur throughout the state and are predominantly slivers. Most often these are a result of
disagreement between county boundaries on ownership. The total acreage of overlaps is not significant,
but we do aim to resolve these over time. As of the 2025b release we now offer a report of overlaps at
each release. The zip file contains a gdb itemizing overlaps at the holding level and a readme describing
the various attributes. This can be downloaded at: https://bit.ly/overlap_analysis
2) Historically CPAD updates were focused heavily on the 50 largest agencies/organizations who own
98% of the acres in CPAD. Of the remaining agencies, many of these have been carefully assessed at one
point but are not actively surveyed for each release. Efforts are being made to secure better review of
these smaller agencies/organizations, through the use of the CPAD MapCollaborator application
(www.mapcollaborator.org/cpad) which allows any user to quickly review their holdings in CPAD and
inform GreenInfo of needed changes. California’s 30x30 efforts have also allowed for an increase in data
collection from smaller agencies. We anticipate this trend will continue over the next decade to allow for
more accurate land tracking.
3) Parcel alignment in some areas is also not complete – while most of CPAD data is parcel aligned, there
are areas of the state where this is not yet the case, or where there are small differences to parcels.
Users can use the “aligned to” code in the CPAD Holding attributes to determine alignment basis.
●​ Southern California Desert: CPAD lands in eastern Riverside and San Bernardino are mostly
aligned to BLM base data – these areas are almost entirely BLM-owned and BLM ownerships
here change rapidly, making use of the BLM base data (instead of parcels) more efficient in
relation to the resources we currently have available, except in developed areas where parcels
are mainly used in CPAD.
●​ In some cities, CPAD holdings may overlap development in aerial photos indicating that parcel
alignment has not yet occurred – there should be little of this error as of 2013.
●​ With some agencies, occasional holdings are not aligned to parcels where those agencies have
confirmed that their data has been field surveyed, and parcels have been shown to be
inaccurate.
●​ Areas of the central Sierra and northern California have significant acreages of US Forest Service
lands that are not yet parcel aligned.
Other CPAD issues:
4) Small slivers and gaps occur in the dataset where polygons are not seamlessly aligned.

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

25

5) The Access attribute in CPAD is sometimes a best estimate, as GreenInfo is not able to fully determine
the access status of every parcel in CPAD – where access cannot be determined, and there is no evidence
of closed access, it is assumed to be “Open Access.” “Open Access” means lands are open to the public
for agency-designated use. Historically, the data has used “Unknown” as a fourth access type, but this
domain will be retired in future versions of CPAD. User feedback on these codes is always welcome. ​

CPAD Releases and History

Current CPAD Release Improvements (v. 2025b)
The 2025b release of CPAD includes the following updates:
●​ The 2025b includes an addition of 20,000 acres. Many agencies saw additions to their lands
including: East Bay Municipal Utilities District (EBMUD), The Nature Conservancy, Contra Costa
Water District, Santa Clara Valley Habitat Agency, and many more.
●​ Parcelization across the board of large lands, resulting in more accurate and detailed
parcel-aligned holdings.

As with any large data gathering program, there are likely to be lands that have been missed, wrongly
included, or mis-attributed. We welcome feedback on corrections – see www.calands.org for more
information, including information about GreenInfo’s MapCollaborator application, which allows online
markup of mapped CPAD data with comments and proposed revisions. You can also email us at
cpad@calands.org.

History of CPAD​
CPAD was developed out of efforts to create regional open space databases in parts of California. In the
San Francisco Bay Area, tabular inventories by Greenbelt Alliance in the 1980s led to GIS-based
inventories in the mid-1990s by the then-newly formed GreenInfo Network. This data was created based
primarily on USGS topographic maps, comparing paper maps of owning agencies and digitizing the
resulting boundaries. Originally, the protected lands data included only lands of 10 acres or greater and
included some public lands that were not entirely open space (the original data title was “Public Lands
Database”). In 2005, funding was secured to begin including Bay Area urban parks through the support
of TOGETHER Bay Area, the earliest partner in the development of CPAD.

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

26

In the early 2000s, the State of California developed an initial statewide coverage of protected lands
known as the Public and Conservation Trust Lands (PCTL) database. This data included mainly state and
federal lands owned in fee (with some other lands included), and was developed through a consortium
of these agencies (last updated in 2005). PCTL, however, did not cover regional and local land holdings
very completely and is now a legacy data set, replaced by CPAD.
In the early 2000s, funding from the Resources Legacy Fund helped underwrite expansions of CPAD data
to other parts of the state. In 2005, GreenInfo Network received special funding from the Annenberg
Foundation to begin work on a Southern California version of the Bay Area database, and shortly
thereafter funding was also secured from the California Coastal Commission for inventories of the
Central Coast and Southern Central Valley. These data inventories were built up from newly available
GIS-based assessor’s parcels to ensure accuracy and consistency. The Bay Area database was also revised
to begin matching available digital assessor parcels during this time period. First versions of this data
were completed in late 2006.
In late 2006, GreenInfo Network also completed work on its first version of the ParkInfo web portal to
support public access to this data – www.parkinfo.org provides users the chance to find parks near
them, in particular cities, or by zip code and then get maps, lists and driving instructions, and follow out
web links to source agency sites for more details (in mid-2012, the ParkInfo web map was greatly
upgraded).
In mid-2007, funding was secured from the California Department of Parks and Recreation to complete
the state and to improve existing data accuracy and currency. During this version 1.1 revision, the entire
file structure of the databases was overhauled, migrating the files to an ESRI file geodatabase format,
integrating them into a single file and greatly increasing the attribute robustness of the database.
In 2008 through mid-2009, further extensive updating was conducted (see Release History for details),
greatly improving the coverage, accuracy and completeness of the database.
Two editions of CPAD were released in 2010. These were all incremental improvements that expanded
alignment to parcels, improved the accuracy of data and included newly acquired holdings. Also in 2010,
GreenInfo’s MapCollaborator web application was launched as an online tool to let CPAD users more
easily point out where corrections to CPAD are needed.
CPAD also became a major data source for the USGS Gap Analysis Program’s Protected Areas Database of
the U.S. (PAD-US) in 2010.
In January 2011, another update of CPAD was released, followed by a release in September 2011. The
next release was published in July 2012 and was a minor update.
In late 2012, GreenInfo Network began a major project to improve CPAD, supported by a 20 month grant
from the California Strategic Growth Council in collaboration with the USGS Gap Analysis Program. This
project enabled GreenInfo to make major improvements in the quality of CPAD data and in the processes

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

27

used to develop and maintain CPAD. It also supported an active outreach program to educate users and
provide more extensive user support. This funding ended in April 2014.
From April 2014 to early 2015, there was no direct support of CPAD from any agency or organization.
However, two projects aided in various improvements to CPAD: 1) the development of CaliParks.org, a
mobile-friendly park finder application supported by the Resources Legacy Fund and developed by
Stamen Design with GreenInfo Network providing editing and expanded CPAD data (including site URLs
for the 800 largest parks).
In early 2015, the California Natural Resources Agency contracted with GreenInfo Network for two years
of CPAD support, through the California Department of Water Resources. This work funds twice-yearly
updates of CPAD (and CCED, the easement data), and outreach and engagement about CPAD and its use.
In spring 2018, GreenInfo Network received generous funding from the California Natural Resources
Agency and Department of Water Resources to continue this important work through spring 2020.
Additionally, CPAD and CCED are now hosted on the CNRA’s open data portal at
https://data.cnra.ca.gov/organization/protected-areas-gis-data.

CPAD Release History

Version 2025a– Published June 2025, this release saw an addition of 20,000 acres of new lands, including two new
National Monuments: Sáttítla Highlands and Chuckwalla. Removal of approximately 8,000 acres of land including
errors, some of which were shifted into CCED as easements.
Version 2024b– Published December 2024. Addition of over 40,000 acres including lands from Mojave Desert Land
Trust, San Joaquin Council of Governments, San Diego County, River Partners, Marin County, and Sequoia
Riverlands Trust. Significant improvements have been made in improving and expanding GAP codes, with continued
support from agencies resulting in an additional 79,000 acres qualifying for 30x30 since the last release. Removal of
approximately 1,900 acres. Nearly 50% of the lands removed were lands that are protected by conservation
easement and thus represented in CCED instead of CPAD. The remaining acres were removed as the result of
improving park boundaries, removing private lands, and changes in land uses.
Version 2024a- Published in June 2024, this release contained the addition of over 144,000 acres with new and
revised lands in 58 of California’s 58 counties. Significant improvements were made in improving and expanding
GAP codes. PADUS 4.0, updated data from California State Parks, as well as over 80 agencies and organizations have
all been included resulting in over 385,000 acres qualifying for 30x30. Removal of approximately 17,075 acres also
occurred. Of the lands removed, over 75% were lands that were sold in fee title but are now protected via
conservation easement and thus represented in CCED instead of CPAD.
Version 2023b– No release, 2023b was not released due to contracting and budget constraints.
Version 2023a – Published in June 2023, this was the only release for the year of 2023. It included an addition of
175,000 acres, significant spatial geometry improvements, as well as the removal of 985 acres.

CPAD Database Manual, version 2025b

28

Version 2022b– Published December 2022. A net addition of approximately 88,000 acres were added within 32 of
California’s 58 counties. Notable additions: BLM lands, Carrizo Plane Conservancy, Mojave National Preserve,
McArthur Swamp, Lassen/Shasta/ Sierra National Forests, Grouse Ridge Forest. Key improvements were made for
lands held by over 36 agencies. In a continued effort to resolve overlaps and slivers, roughly 85,000 acres were
removed.
Version 2022a– Published July 2022. The release marked an important bug fix in the GAP code assignments for
CPAD and CCED lands, and as a result we now assign all lands that contain GAP data in PAD-US, CDPR, or from a
local agency. Included an incremental increase in the integration of GAP Codes, through input of local agencies.
This release added over 65,000 acres in 31 out of California’s 58 counties. Removal of 300 acres.
Version 2021b– Published December 2021. Added over 28,000 acres and over 200 new/expanded units. 2021b also
included additional Gap Code acres for more CDPR lands. Extensive edits in the Delta, adding over 25,000 acres
through new and improved boundaries. New and revised lands in 48 of California’s 58 counties. Removal of
approximately 37,000 acres. Over 95% of acres removed were a result of improved BLM, NPS, and USFS boundaries
detailed above.
Version 2021a– Published July 2021. Over 60,000 acres were added across 55 of California' s 58 counties. More
than 150 California cities had new or revised city parks. We reviewed and resolved 100 contributions from
MapCollaborator submissions. Divided large holdings of BLM and USFS lands at parcel geometry. Information on
the GAP status code for each holding, unit and super unit was added. These data are now present in each
geographic level as a total estimated acreage of the holding/unit/super unit that is GAP code 1, 2, 3, or 4.
Version 2020b– Originally published December 2020, updated January 2021. The January 2021 update was
conducted to include GAP Code fields missing in the original December 2020 release, no other changes were made.
The most current shapefiles include "2020b" in the name, for example "CPAD_2020b_Units.shp".
Version 2020a– Published June 2020. Approximately 30,000 acres were added across 48 of Californias’ 58 counties.
Over 100 cities had new or revised parks data, along with new and revised lands for over 20 state agencies, lands
trusts, and non profit organizations.
Version 2019b – Published November 2019. A total of nearly 150,000 acres added, including approximately 10,000
acres in the Klamath and Shasta-Trinity National Forests. Continued focus on the accuracy of community parks in
support of ensuring equitable access to recreation, a special project with the California Department of Parks and
Recreation. Moderate additions to the Year Protected and Year Established fields. Significant edits and additions to
conserved lands in Riverside County. New and revised city parks in: Carlsbad, Chico, Fowler, King City, Oceanside,
Lake Elsinore, Los Angeles, Manteca, Merced, Murrieta, Redlands, San Diego, San Ramon, Santa Paula, Santa Rosa,

agencies/organizations and roughly 1,000 more holdings than CPAD 1.7, with a net increase of over 65,000 acres of
protected areas. The field “d_acq_yr” was added for acquisition dates (currently only available in the Bay Area).
​
Version 1.7 – Released September 11, 2011. This version of CPAD continues to refine the database with better
parcel alignment, removal of inferior legacy data, and addition of newly protected areas. CPAD 1.7 includes 24

region. Orange County in particular has been completely updated and aligned to parcel data, with many new sites
added to CPAD. This version more accurately captures the transition of lands from the State Land Commission or
lands trust to the BLM in the desert region. National Park boundaries have been revised based upon more accurate
alignment. Homeowner associations’ parks have now begun to be incorporated into CPAD. Data is better aligned to
parcels throughout the state. In general, the top 20 agencies/organizations have been surveyed for new data and
revisions made accordingly in CPAD.​

region, plus updates to all federal and state agencies generally. Most land trust data was updated, especially in the
Bay Area, the Sierra Nevada region and the San Joaquin Valley. Super Units, used for cartography were revised so
that they aggregate just federal and state holdings (national forests, etc.) across county boundaries – other
ownerships retain their Unit-based configuration. Managing agencies were more fully identified (especially Calif.
Dept. of Fish & Game), but not all managing agencies are yet identified. CPAD 1.6 also removed a dozen State Lands
holdings that were Calif. State Univ. campuses or prisons.
Version 1.4 – Released February 3, 2010. CPAD 1.4 features updated city data in most areas of the state, and

open spaces within incorporated areas of San Diego County have been updated extensively. The San Joaquin Valley
data is greatly improved from the smallest city parks to larger state and federal preserves. In the nine county Bay
Area, CPAD 1.6 is aligned to parcels and more inclusive. Special attention was paid to updating Calif. DFG and US
FWS lands across the state. Super Units is a new feature class in CPAD 1.6. They differ from Units in that Super units
are not divided by owning/managing agency or by county. Super units are intended to be used for cartographic
purposes.
Version 1.3 – Released August 27, 2009. The CPAD 1.3 has a more extensive management attributes, especially in
regards to CDFG and CDPR managed lands that are owned by other agencies such as the State Lands Commission,
BLM and Bureau of Reclamation. In addition management around reservoir areas is now more accurate. Version 1.3
continues to capture more urban park coverage. GreenInfo Network relied heavily on the CPAD user community to
report errors in CPAD through www.calands.org. Federal and state agency data has been aligned and updated
throughout the state. CPAD 1.3 has improved parcel alignment and more extensive and accurate attributes. This
work has been supported by grants from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the California
Endowment, and the Resources Legacy Fund Preserving Wild California program.
